# JavaScript Type Coercion Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to type coercion and its unexpected behavior. The `myFunc` function showcases issues with handling zero values and lack of type validation, potentially resulting in `Infinity` or `TypeError` exceptions.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with improved type checking and error handling.
